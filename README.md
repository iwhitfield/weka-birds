Weka Birds
==========

A University assignment based around the [ai-birds](https://aibirds.org/) competition. The task was to play the game using a Bayesian learning component & Weka.

Simply run `ab.demo.AssignmentAgent` to run the Agent.

### Results

This Agent was tested on levels 1 - 36 with a good success rate. Testing stopped here due to a lack of time, but level 36 is far enough into the game to have tested against all bird types, and across levels which require more strategy than simply firing a bird directly at a pig.
